<img src = "lamonedapalace.jpg" width = "300" alt = "Couldn't load image"> 
 <p style="background-image: url('lamonedapalace.jpg');">

The La Moneda Presidential Palace is one of the most representative symbols of Chilean political history.<br>
 <strong>Designed by the architect</strong> <em>Joaquin Toesca</em>, this palace has served as the headquarters of the country’s Executive Power.<br>
 Inaugurated in 1805, and named the Royal House of La Moneda de Santiago, it was originally used for coin minting.<br>
 In 1846, the Government moved into this building, where for over a century it was inhabited by the Republic’s Presidents, until 1958.<br>
 <strong>In 1951</strong> it was declared a National Monument.<br>
In addition, the <em>La Moneda </em>Presidential Palace was also the venue of one of the <strong>country’s most dramatic</strong> historical moments.<br>
 On <strong>September 11, 1973 </strong>the <strong>building was bombed</strong>, and then later it was restored, following the original lines of <em>Toesca</em>.<br>
Although entry to the <em>La Moneda </em>Presidential Palace is only allowed in a guided tour, which must be reserved at least<strong> one week in advance</strong>, visitors can see the “change of the presidential guards”, explore the magnificent gardens of this <em>neoclassical</em> palace and enjoy the art exhibitions of the <em>Palacio La Moneda Cultural Center</em>, located under the <em>Plaza de la Ciudadanía</em>.<br>
The <em>La Moneda </em>Presidential Palace, central point of the <em>Plaza de la Constitución</em>, is a must for anyone visiting the Chilean capital.<br> It is located in the center of Santiago, only a 10 minutes walk from the Plaza de Armas.<br>

Its Spanish (and official Ecuadorian) name <em>"San Cristóbal"</em> comes from the patron saint of seafarers, St. Christopher.<br>
